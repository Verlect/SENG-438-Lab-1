# Introduction

Throughout this lab, we learnt that testing is a team effort and that everyone needs to work together in order for the problem to be running as bug-free as possible. It is important to us that we do this in a organized way so that all the bugs that we discover is addressed properly and in proper form. Our approach to this lab is primarly making sure that the application is performing the required functions correctly.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

High-Level Exploratory Plan is characterized by the requirements mandated by Appendix B of the lab handout. Therefore, the main functions targeted would include basic functions of an ATM such as inserting a card, depositing, withdrawing, etc. The approach taken is to test the main ATM functions the most extensively as this is the most importantly defined in the program requirements. Apart from this, tests are based on tester's intuition and what they believe will break the code.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing
Exploratory testing is a method of software testing in which the tester actively explores the application to find defects rather than following a specific test script or plan. It is typically done in a necessary, informal manner and emphasizes the tester's expertise and intuition in finding defects.

On the other hand, manual functional testing is a method of software testing in which the tester follows a specific test script or plan to test the application's functionality. It is typically done formally structured manner and emphasizes the tester's ability to follow procedures and document results.

In summary, exploratory testing focuses more on the tester's expertise and intuition, while manual functional testing focuses more on following procedures and documenting results. However, both methods have advantages and can be used together for more thorough testing.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

Peer reviewing defect reports allotted our group better accountability in our bug reports. It also allowed us to not only “burnout” slower, but also it allows us to gain a better circulation in ideas. 


# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

Our general pair testing management is outlined in the lab handout. In short, our group of four split into 2 groups of two for each of the testing types. To reduce “burnout” and to give every member the opportunity to experience the totality of this lab, we would switch roles every so often or at request.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

The following lab was an appropriate pilot for this software testing course. However, we believe that there is room to improve on "Instruction Presentation". We found that we had to go on a mini scavenger hunt everytime we wanted to continue to the next deliverable. Ultimately, this decreased our efficiency.
